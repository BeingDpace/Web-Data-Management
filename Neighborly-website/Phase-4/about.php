          <p>The main purpose of this project is to bring these immigrants who have left their countries due to
various reasons, so they will be able to share their experience, culture, meet virtually and share
songs, recipes, nostalgia, etc. Also, the immigrants who have already been here for a while can
share rules and laws of country, share tips, share information about places to visit, restaurants,
museums, views, etc. The super admin, admin per country, and immigrants are three most critical
components of this project.</p>
